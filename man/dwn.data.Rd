This datafile is simulated; it is not from a real laboratory experiment. However, it is based upon the actual data and modeling of real data from a published experiment reported in Figure 2, pp 3039 from Faessel et al (1998) [Faessel HM, Slocum HK, Jackson RC, Boritzki TJ, Rustum YM, Nair MG and Greco WR: Super in vitro synergy between inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase and inhibitors of other folate-requiring enzymes: The critical role of polyglutamylation. Cancer Res 58:3036-3050, 1998].
